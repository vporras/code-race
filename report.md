Final Report
============

## The Unity game
+ We chose to use Unity because of its cross-platform release capabilities. However, Google Chome began phasing out support for the Unity web plugin while we were working on the project. This illustrates some of the risks of trusting external frameworks.
+ We started by building a minimum standard of a racing game, then added AI features to it. This made it possible to quickly integrate it with other parts so the rest of us could work on it.

## The frontend wrapper for the game
+ The frontend wrapper is very minimalistic, so it was very easy to integrate the Unity game.

## The backend
+ We ended up using a different language, Go, for the backend because on of our team members was familiar with it.


## Team work and communication
+ We organized ourselves pretty organically, people largely chose for themselves what to work on.
+ We mostly communicated via Facebook and email, with only a few in person meetings.
+ Near the deadline, it was difficult to get in touch with everyone. It would have been a good idea to share phone numbers.
+ We did most of the work in the first two weeks and the last week. Maybe we could have done more if we'd had some sort of weekly meeting to keep everyone on track.
