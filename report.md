Final Report
============

## Overall design
+ We used github to organize our code and docs. This was a very good decision, it made sharing the work between five people easy. It also allowed us to learn how to use source control, which will be very beneficial in future.
+ We wrote an API doc as we went along to structure all the interactions between modules.
+ We separated out the project into multiple layers, which made it possible to work on different parts at the same time without the risk of breaking the whole thing. This made our source control easier to manage.

## The Unity game
+ We chose to use Unity because of its cross-platform release capabilities. However, Google Chome began phasing out support for the Unity web plugin while we were working on the project. This illustrates some of the risks of trusting external frameworks.
+ A few weeks into development of our project, Unity 5 was released. We opted to all stay with unity 4 as we had just learnt it and a few members were having difficulty getting it to run on their machines. This then led to the lack of support from chrome mentioned above. More prior research into the unity software may have helped this. 
+ We started by building a minimum standard of a racing game, then added AI features to it. This made it possible to quickly integrate it with other parts so the rest of us could work on it. 

## The frontend wrapper for the game
+ The frontend wrapper is very minimalistic, so it was very easy to integrate the Unity game.

## The backend
+ We ended up using a different language, Go, for the backend because one of our team members was familiar with it.

## Team work and communication
+ We organized ourselves pretty organically, people largely chose for themselves what to work on.
+ We mostly communicated via Facebook and email, with only a few in person meetings.
+ Near the deadline, it was difficult to get in touch with everyone. It would have been a good idea to share phone numbers, as opposed to organizing everything online.
+ We did most of the work in the first two weeks and the last week. Perhaps we could have done more if we'd had some sort of weekly meeting to keep everyone on track.
